The organization's main goal is to ensure that these children have access to comfortable, well-fitted shoes that will help prevent foot injuries and other health problems.

To achieve this goal, the foundation conducts research on the needs of children with larger foot sizes, collaborates with shoe manufacturers to develop specialized footwear, and provides financial assistance to families who cannot afford to purchase appropriate shoes for their children.
